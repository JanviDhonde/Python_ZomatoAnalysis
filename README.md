## Zomato Data Analysis Using Python 🍽️📊

### 📋 Project Overview
This project analyzes Zomato's restaurant data to uncover insights into customer preferences, spending habits, and restaurant performance. Using Python, we performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations to answer critical questions and provide actionable insights for Zomato.

### 🎯 Objective
To analyze Zomato restaurant data and address key business questions:
- What type of restaurants do customers prefer?
- How many votes do different types of restaurants receive?
- What are the most common ratings?
- What is the average spending on food orders?
- Which mode (online or offline) receives better ratings?
- Which type of restaurant receives more offline orders?

### ✨ Key Insights and Features
- **Restaurant Preference**: Dining restaurants are the most popular.
- **Votes Analysis**: Dining restaurants receive the maximum votes.
- **Ratings Distribution**: Most restaurants are rated between 3.5 and 4.
- **Couples' Spending Habits**: Average spending by couples is around ₹300.
- **Mode of Orders**: Online orders receive higher ratings compared to offline.
- **Offline Order Trends**: Dining restaurants dominate offline orders.

### 🛠 Tools and Technologies Used
- **Python Libraries**:
  - `Pandas`: Data manipulation and cleaning.
  - `NumPy`: Numerical operations.
  - `Matplotlib` & `Seaborn`: Data visualization.
- **Data Source**: Zomato dataset in CSV format.
